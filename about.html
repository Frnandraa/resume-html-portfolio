<h1>More About Me</h1>
<p>
    I am someone with high passion and dedication. My hobby of singing is not only an escape from routine, 
    but also a source of happiness and creativity. 
    My voice is able to touch hearts and bring joy to the people around me.</p>

<p>My character is a mix of firmness and warmth. I enjoy healthy debate, which shows that I have critical thinking and the 
    ability to see different points of view.
    This makes me a broad-minded individual and open to new ideas. 
    I am also surrounded by constructive and positive friends, which reflects my attitude of appreciating
    support and inspiration from others.</p>

<p>I have big dreams to develop and reach the top in my career. Maybe my dream is to work for 
    a large company where I can bring innovation and positive impact, 
    or maybe to grow my own business into a successful and widely known network. 
    I don't like being in a toxic and lazy environment, because I value productivity and positive energy in my life.</p>
